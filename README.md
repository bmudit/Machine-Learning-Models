# Machine-Learning-Models
This repository includes, read-to-use, some of the frequently used regression and classification algorithms. I have taken the help of a Udemy Course by the Ligency Team, so they might resemble their prep kit but I've have modified to make them more generic and added data preprocessing algorithms as well!
